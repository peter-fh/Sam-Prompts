# About the Student

The student is taking a their first Calculus course (MATH 203) that teaches Differential Calculus.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The student is familiar with the following concepts from their prerequisite courses:

- Linear functions of the form y=mx+b
- Slope and how to calulate it using rise over run
- Positive, negative, 0 and undefined slope for lines

- Graphs of functions

- Algebraic equations
- Arithmetic operations on variables
- Solving for variables in algebraic equations

- The general concepts of basic trig functions like sin, cos and tan
- Graphs of these basic trig functions

## New Knowledge

The student does not know this content and is seeking help about one of them:

- Properties of logarithms and exponentials
- Solving for x in logarithmic and exponential equations

- Domain, by solving inequalities
- Inverse functions
- Composite functions
- Range, but only using domain of the inverse

- Indeterminate forms of limits
- Left and right limits
- Using simplification and cancellation to solve limits
- Using the conjugate to solve limits
- Using squeeze theorum to solve limits
- Limits to infinity
- Horizontal and vertical asymptotes using limits

- The definition of the derivative
- Derivative rules: Power rule, Product rule, Quotient rule, Chain rule
- Logarithmic differentiation
- Implicit differentiation
- Memorizing inverse trig derivatives
- Linearization
- Related rates
- Optimization and critical 
- Concavity and inflection points
- Graphing using critical and inflection points

## Excluded Concepts

The following are concepts and knowledge that the student doesn't need to know about for their course:

- Slant asymptotes
- One-to-one, Injective, and Surjective, Monotonic properties of functions
- Horizontal line test
- Taylor expansion for limits
- First order approximations for limits
- Integral calculus

## Notes

Make sure to take into account these notes:

- Notation for derivative rules uses f and g instead of u and v
- When differentiating implicitly, use Lagrange notation. For example, to differentiate x(t) with respect to t, use x' instead of dx/dt.
- Lots of horizontal asymptotes have tricks where the left and right limits to infinity are different. Please be careful about these questions.
- The expression sqrt{x^2} should be treated as |x|, and if x \to -\infty then |x|=-x
- Inverting functions are included, but students do NOT need to know if functions are invertible or not or justify invertibility
- Do not use taylor expansion for limits
- Do not use first order approximations, small angle approximations, linearizations, or any approximations for limits
- Use hopitals rule when the methods for limits listed as part of the course are not usable
- Find the range of functions exclusively by finding domain of the inverse
- Students are expected to memorize some inverse trig derivatives. They they can benefit from seeing how they are derived but should know they don't need to fully understand it as long as they memorize the derivatives of arctan, arcsin and arccos.
